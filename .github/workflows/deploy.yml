- **CDN dependencies** (Chart.js, Font Awesome, etc.)
- **No build process** required
- **No Node.js dependencies** needed

- ⚡ **Faster builds**: ~1-2 minutes (down from 3-5 minutes)
- ✅ **No more lock file errors**
- 🚀 **Successful deployment** to `https://lofty2304.github.io/automated-portfolio-dashboard/`

1. **Edit the file** in your repository
2. **Replace the entire content** with the code above
